## Phase 2: Advanced Rider Management (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 Intelligent Assignment Algorithm
**Technical Approach:**
- Implement distance-based rider assignment
- Factor in rider availability and current load
- Consider rider ratings and performance metrics
- Optimize for delivery time and cost

**Algorithm Components:**
```typescript
interface RiderAssignmentCriteria {
  maxDistance: number; // Maximum distance from pickup
  minRating: number; // Minimum rider rating
  maxActiveOrders: number; // Maximum concurrent orders
  vehicleType: 'motorcycle' | 'bicycle' | 'car';
}
```

### 2.2 Rider Status Management
**Features:**
- Real-time online/offline status
- Break management system
- Shift scheduling
- Automatic status updates based on activity

**Database Schema:**
```sql
riders_status (
  rider_id,
  is_online,
  current_location,
  last_ping,
  active_orders_count,
  shift_start,
  shift_end
)
```

### 2.3 Performance Tracking
**Metrics to Track:**
- Average delivery time
- Customer satisfaction rating
- Order completion rate
- Peak hour performance
- Distance traveled per shift

## Phase 3: GPS Tracking & Route Optimization (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 Google Maps Integration
**Technical Approach:**
- Implement Google Maps JavaScript API
- Use Directions API for route calculation
- Distance Matrix API for delivery time estimation
- Places API for address autocomplete

**Required APIs:**
- GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
- Enable: Maps JavaScript API, Directions API, Places API, Distance Matrix API

### 3.2 Real-time Location Updates
**WebSocket Implementation:**
```typescript
// Server-side WebSocket handler
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('rider:location:update', (data) => {
    // Update rider location in database
    // Broadcast to relevant customers
    socket.to(`order:${data.orderId}`).emit('rider:location', data);
  });
});

// Client-side tracking
const trackRider = (orderId: string) => {
  socket.on(`rider:location`, (location) => {
    updateMapMarker(location);
    updateETA(location);
  });
};
```

### 3.3 Route Optimization
**Features:**
- Multi-stop delivery optimization
- Traffic-aware routing
- Dynamic rerouting based on conditions
- Delivery time predictions

**Algorithm:**
- Use Google's Route Optimization API
- Implement traveling salesman problem solver for multiple deliveries
- Factor in traffic data and road conditions
- Provide alternative routes

### 3.4 Customer Tracking Interface
**UI Components:**
- Live map with rider location
- Estimated time of arrival (ETA)
- Delivery progress indicators
- Push notifications for status updates

## Phase 4: Infrastructure & Integration (Week 7-8)

### 4.1 Database Optimizations
- Add indexes for location-based queries
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Set up read replicas for scaling
- Archive old transaction data

### 4.2 Security Enhancements
- PCI compliance for payment data
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive information
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Fraud detection system

### 4.3 Monitoring & Analytics
- Set up application performance monitoring
- Implement error tracking (Sentry)
- Create business intelligence dashboards
- Real-time metrics for operations team

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Focus Area | Deliverables |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1-2 | Payment Gateways | GCash & Maya integration, payment UI |
| 3-4 | Rider Management | Assignment algorithm, status system |
| 5-6 | GPS Tracking | Maps integration, real-time updates |
| 7-8 | Infrastructure | Security, monitoring, optimization |

## Required Environment Variables

```env

GCASH_SECRET_KEY=
GCASH_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
MAYA_PUBLIC_KEY=
MAYA_SECRET_KEY=
MAYA_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET=

## Testing Strategy

### Payment Testing
- Use sandbox environments for all payment gateways
- Test successful payments, failures, and refunds
- Verify webhook handling and retries
- Load test payment processing

### Rider System Testing
- Simulate multiple riders and orders
- Test assignment algorithm edge cases
- Verify status updates and notifications
- Performance test with high volume

### GPS Tracking Testing
- Test with real device locations
- Verify accuracy of route calculations
- Test WebSocket connection stability
- Measure update latency

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Staging Environment**: Set up staging with sandbox payment APIs
2. **Progressive Rollout**: Deploy features incrementally
3. **Feature Flags**: Use feature toggles for gradual enablement
4. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to quickly revert changes
5. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for critical metrics

## Success Metrics

- Payment success rate > 95%
- Average rider assignment time < 30 seconds
- Location update latency < 2 seconds
- Customer satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- Delivery time accuracy within 5 minutes

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Payment gateway downtime | Implement fallback payment methods |
| GPS signal loss | Store last known location, use predictive routing |
| High server load | Auto-scaling, load balancing, caching |
| Data breach | Encryption, regular security audits |
| Rider shortage | Dynamic pricing, incentive system |

## Next Steps

1. Obtain API credentials for payment gateways
2. Set up development sandbox environments
3. Create detailed technical specifications
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
