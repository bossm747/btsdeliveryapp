For a delivery app using Google Maps, you’ll need several APIs and SDKs depending on your platform and features. Here are the key components:

## Google Maps APIs

**Maps JavaScript API** (for web) or **Maps SDK for Android/iOS** (for mobile)

- Display interactive maps
- Show delivery locations, routes, and driver positions
- Customize markers for restaurants, customers, and drivers

**Places API**

- Search for restaurants and delivery addresses
- Auto-complete address entry
- Get detailed place information including photos and reviews

**Geocoding API**

- Convert addresses to coordinates and vice versa
- Validate delivery addresses
- Handle address formatting

**Directions API**

- Calculate optimal routes between pickup and delivery points
- Get turn-by-turn navigation instructions
- Estimate delivery times and distances
- Support multiple waypoints for batch deliveries

**Distance Matrix API**

- Calculate travel times and distances between multiple origins and destinations
- Useful for assigning orders to the nearest available drivers
- Bulk calculations for route optimization

## Additional Google Services

**Geolocation API**

- Determine user’s current location
- Auto-populate delivery addresses

**Roads API** (optional)

- Snap GPS coordinates to roads for more accurate tracking
- Useful for real-time driver tracking

**Google Cloud Functions** or **Firebase Functions**

- Backend serverless functions for processing deliveries
- Handle webhooks and real-time updates

## Platform-Specific SDKs

**For Android:**

- Google Play Services Location API
- Maps SDK for Android

**For iOS:**

- Google Maps SDK for iOS
- Core Location Framework

**For Web:**

- Maps JavaScript API
- Google Maps Platform Web Services

## Pricing Considerations

Most Google Maps APIs use pay-per-use pricing, but Google provides $200 in free monthly usage credits. For a delivery app, you’ll want to monitor usage of the Directions API and Distance Matrix API as these tend to be the most frequently called.

Would you like me to elaborate on implementing any specific API or discuss the architecture for integrating these services into your delivery app?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
